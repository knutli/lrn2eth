# How the fuck do I push and pull?

## The most important commands

**git add .**

- Marks all the stuff you have added or changed with a "this stuff is ready for some action"-mark

**git commit -m "your message"**

- Now you're getting serious. You're putting all the stuff that has been marked for some action into a _"push this shit onto Github, dude"-queue._ But it doesn't push yet. It's just getting ready for push.

**git push**

- Push push!
- Holy shit, you're doing it! You're syncing your local directory with your Github repo.
- If you're only on one branch, that's all there's to it. The changes you have made to your code locally is now on Github.
- However, if you've made several branches, like dev, test and prod, you have to juggle changes to these different branches.

**git branch**

- See which branches you have made.
- If you do git branch NAME, you create a new branch with name NAME.
- If you do git branch -D NAME, you delete that same branch.

**git checkout <branch>**

- Change from your current branch to the branch you specify

**git merge <branch>**

- Merge the specified branch into the currently active branch. So make sure you're on the branch you're merging _into_!
